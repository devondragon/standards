## Entity purpose

The Category entity defines the hierarchical and navigational structure used to group and organize products. It is central to product discovery, navigation, and merchandising strategies across both B2B and B2C environments. Categories are typically managed in Commerce Engines, PIM systems, and DXP solutions, supporting multi-level hierarchies, localization, and business-specific taxonomies.

- Groups products into logical structures
- Enables product discovery through navigation and search
- Supports merchandising and campaign strategies
- Drives SEO and channel-specific taxonomies
- Localizes the product experience by region or language
- Organizes catalog hierarchies for both internal and customer-facing use

## Localization Pattern

All fields that are displayed to end users support flexible localization. Fields can accept either a simple string (for single-language stores) or a localized object (for multi-language stores).

### Single Language (Simple String)
```json
{
  "name": "Shorts",
  "description": "Comfortable shorts for all occasions"
}
```

### Multi-Language (Localized Object)
```json
{
  "name": {
    "en-US": "Shorts",
    "de-DE": "Shorts",
    "fr-FR": "Shorts"
  },
  "description": {
    "en-US": "Comfortable shorts for all occasions",
    "de-DE": "Bequeme Shorts f√ºr alle Gelegenheiten",
    "fr-FR": "Shorts confortables pour toutes les occasions"
  }
}
```

This pattern applies to all localizable fields including:
- `name` - Category display name
- `description` - Category description
- `slug` - URL-friendly identifier (can vary by language)
- `seo` fields - All SEO metadata
- `media.alt_text` - Image alternative text
- Extension fields that contain display text

## Core Components & Relationships

### Components

| Concept    | Description                    | Typical Source of Truth         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| ID         | Unique category identifier     | Commerce Engine / PIM / CMS     |
| Hierarchy  | Parent-child relationships     | PIM / Commerce Engine           |
| Extensions | Optional and scoped extensions | SEO Tools / Merchandising / PIM |
| Media      | Category images and assets     | DAM / CDN / CMS                 |

### Typical Relationships

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Category:::entity 1 to 1 Category : "references via Parent ID"
    Category 1 to 1+ "Category (Children)":::internalRel : "contains children"
    Category 1 to 1 Media:::optionalRel : "has assets"

## Typical Pitfalls

### Hierarchy and Structure
- **Not supporting multi-level or nested category hierarchies** - Limits the ability to structure products logically, harming site navigation and SEO.
- **Missing position/sort order field** - Results in inconsistent category ordering across channels and poor user experience.
- **Not supporting multiple parent categories** - A category may need to exist under multiple parents (e.g., "Hiking Boots" under both "Footwear" and "Camping Equipment").
- **Confusing parent_id with primary parent** - When a category has multiple parents, one should be designated as primary for breadcrumb building.

### Localization and Content
- **Poor localization of category names and descriptions** - Creates a disjointed user experience for international customers and reduces search relevancy in localized markets.
- **Not localizing slugs** - Different languages may require different URL structures for SEO optimization.
- **Forgetting to localize media alt text** - Impacts accessibility and SEO in different markets.

### Product Assignment and Discovery
- **Missing ability to assign products to multiple categories** - Results in limited product discoverability and forces duplication or workarounds in merchandising.
- **Not tracking product_count** - Makes it difficult to identify empty categories or optimize navigation.
- **Poor integration with search and filtering systems** - Leads to ineffective faceted search and user frustration during navigation.

### Data Management
- **Not distinguishing between active/inactive/archived states** - Makes it hard to manage seasonal categories or phase out old taxonomies.
- **Not tracking category changes over time** - Makes it difficult to understand performance trends and recover from mistakes.
- **Missing external_references** - Creates integration challenges when syncing categories across PIM, ERP, and commerce systems.
- **Poor governance for managing large taxonomies** - Causes inconsistent category structures and scaling issues as the catalog grows.

### Performance and Implementation
- **Always returning full nested children** - Can create performance issues with deep hierarchies; consider returning just references.
- **Not caching category paths** - Repeatedly calculating breadcrumbs can impact performance.
- **Missing proper indexing on parent_id and position** - Slows down category tree rendering.
