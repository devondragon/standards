## Entity purpose

Holds the real-time, location-level stock picture for a single SKU so every channel can make consistent availability, reservation, and fulfillment decisions. The Inventory entity resides within Inventory Management Systems (IMS), Warehouse Management Systems (WMS), and Order Management Systems (OMS). It serves as the single source of truth for stock levels, enabling accurate availability calculations, reservation management, and multi-location fulfillment strategies.

The model supports:
- **Location-based inventory**: Track stock at warehouses, stores, and 3PL facilities
- **Real-time quantities**: Maintain on-hand, reserved, available, and incoming stock
- **Flexible policies**: Support backorders, pre-orders, and safety stock buffers
- **Multi-channel consistency**: Ensure accurate availability across all sales channels
- **Optimistic concurrency**: Version control for high-frequency updates

## Core Components & Relationships

### Components

| Concept                  | Description                                  | Typical Source |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Inventory**            | Stock per SKU-location record.               | IMS / WMS      |
| **Inventory Location**   | Physical or virtual node (DC, store, 3PL).   | WMS / OMS      |
| **Inventory Policy**     | Oversell & safety-stock ruleset.             | OMS / IMS      |
| **Inventory Adjustment** | Immutable ledger of stock deltas.            | IMS / ERP      |
| **Availability Feed**    | Denormalised edge projection for fast reads. | CDN / API Edge |

## Typical pitfalls

### Caching and Consistency
- **Stale edge caches** - Show in-stock when units are gone, leading to overselling and customer disappointment
- **Eventual consistency delays** - Inventory updates not propagating fast enough across channels
- **Missing cache invalidation** - Changes in one system not triggering updates in dependent systems

### Concurrency and Race Conditions
- **Race conditions without soft-reserve tokens** - Multiple customers buying the last item simultaneously
- **Missing optimistic locking** - Concurrent updates overwriting each other without version control
- **No distributed locking** - Multiple systems updating the same inventory without coordination

### Business Logic Errors
- **Ignoring safety stock** - Erodes fulfillment SLAs and causes stockouts of popular items
- **Not tracking allocated quantity** - Items in carts appear available, leading to abandonment
- **Missing location priorities** - Not optimizing which location fulfills orders

### Architecture Issues
- **No immutable adjustment ledger** - Hinders audit trails and shrinkage analysis
- **Single global inventory pool** - Breaks location-based features like click-and-collect
- **Blocking WMS calls at checkout** - Synchronous inventory checks slow checkout under load
- **No inventory reservation system** - Can't guarantee stock between add-to-cart and payment

### Data Quality Problems
- **Mismatched SKU identifiers** - Different systems using different product IDs
- **Missing incoming inventory tracking** - Can't show "back in stock" dates to customers
- **No damaged/quality hold tracking** - Overselling when some inventory isn't sellable
