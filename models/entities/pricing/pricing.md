## Entity purpose

A unified pricing model that supports flexible, multi-currency pricing across both B2B and B2C commerce scenarios. It resides within Commerce Engines, Pricing Management Systems, and ERP systems. The pricing model supports base pricing, tiered pricing, bulk pricing, dynamic pricing, and promotional adjustments. It serves as the foundational data structure driving pricing strategies, customer segmentation, and revenue optimization.

The Entity describes:
- List price (MSRP) and sale price distinction
- Cost price for internal calculations
- Price list and catalog context associations
- Campaign context for promotional and marketing initiatives
- Tiered pricing for different customer segments
- Bulk pricing for quantity-based discounts
- Dynamic pricing strategies and AI-driven adjustments
- Multi-currency support with conversion rates
- Promotional pricing and business rule adjustments
- Scope-based pricing overrides (region, channel, customer group)
- Tax inclusion and calculation
- Price history and audit trails
- Scheduling and phasing for price changes

## Sample Object: Pricing as a precomputed matrix for Wholesale/B2B

Efficient customer specific prices PRODUCT or CATALOGUE + CUSTOMER SEGMENT or CUSTOMER + CHANNEL and maybe CURRENCY → PRICE

Requires Indexed prices by product/category ID + customer group ID. can be stored in orchestration layer to gain sub 10ms performance.

## Localization Pattern

While prices themselves are numerical values with currency, some pricing-related fields may need localization support:

### Fields Supporting Localization
- Price list names (in extensions)
- Campaign names (in extensions)
- Tax type descriptions (in extensions)
- Unit of measure labels (in extensions)

Example:
```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "display": {
      "pricelist_name": {
        "en-US": "Summer Sale Prices",
        "es-ES": "Precios de Venta de Verano",
        "fr-FR": "Prix Soldes d'Été"
      },
      "unit_label": {
        "en-US": "per unit",
        "es-ES": "por unidad",
        "fr-FR": "par unité"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Core Components & Relationships

### Components

| Concept       | Description                                  | Typical Source of Truth    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| List Price    | Manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) | Price Management System    |
| Sale Price    | Actual selling price to customer             | Price Management System    |
| Cost Price    | Internal cost price (in extensions.internal) | ERP System                 |
| Campaign      | Associated campaign context                  | Campaign Management System |
| Price List    | Associated price list or catalog context     | Price Management System    |
| Currency      | Price currency and conversion rates          | Currency Management System |
| Tax           | Tax inclusion, rate, and type                | Tax Engine                 |
| Extensions    | Optional and scoped extensions               | Various domain systems     |
| Reference Ids | Cross-system identifiers                     | Integration Layer          |

`Pricing` typically resides in many systems, including:

- Commerce Engine
- Price Management System (PMS)
- Campaign Management System
- Promotion Management System
- ERP systems
- Pricing Engine
- Tax Engine

## Typical pitfalls

### Data Structure Issues
- **Not using Money utility object** - Leads to inconsistent price representations and currency handling errors
- **Mixing price and currency in single field** - Creates parsing complexity and prevents proper money calculations
- **Using floats for monetary values** - Results in rounding errors; always use decimal-safe representations

### Schema Design Problems
- **Overloading core schema with business logic** - Use extensions for domain-specific rules instead of core fields
- **Missing external_references** - Creates integration challenges when syncing prices across systems
- **Not distinguishing list vs sale price** - Essential for showing discounts and calculating margins

### Temporal and Validity Issues
- **Missing valid_from/valid_to fields** - Can't schedule price changes or run time-based campaigns
- **No version control for prices** - Can't track price history or audit changes
- **Ignoring timezone in validity dates** - Causes confusion in global operations

### B2B/Wholesale Challenges
- **No support for tiered/bulk pricing** - B2B customers expect volume discounts
- **Missing customer segment pricing** - Can't offer negotiated rates to specific customers
- **No price list concept** - Makes it hard to manage different pricing strategies

### Tax and Compliance
- **Ambiguous tax inclusion** - Must clearly indicate if prices include tax
- **Missing tax calculation details** - Need tax rate and type for proper invoicing
- **No audit trail** - Regulatory compliance requires price change history

### Performance and Scaling
- **Loading all price tiers always** - Use extensions to lazy-load complex pricing rules
- **No caching strategy for matrix pricing** - B2B price matrices need performance optimization
- **Missing channel/region filtering** - Retrieving all prices when only one is needed
