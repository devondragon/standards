## Entity purpose

A unified promotion model that supports flexible, rule-based discount strategies across all commerce channels. It resides within Promotion Management Systems, Commerce Engines, and Marketing Platforms. The promotion model supports percentage, fixed amount, BOGO, free gift, shipping discounts, and complex tiered promotions through a composable rules engine. It serves as the foundational data structure for all promotional activities, from simple discounts to sophisticated multi-condition campaigns.

The Entity describes:
- Rule-based promotion logic with conditions and actions
- Flexible activation methods (automatic, code-based, customer-specific)
- Multi-channel targeting and scheduling
- Usage limits and tracking
- Stacking rules and priority management
- Performance metrics and analytics
- Integration with loyalty and customer segments

## Localization Pattern

All fields that are displayed to end users support flexible localization. Fields can accept either a simple string (for single-language stores) or a localized object (for multi-language stores).

### Single Language (Simple String)
```json
{
  "name": "Summer Sale - 20% Off",
  "description": "Get 20% off on all summer collection items"
}
```

### Multi-Language (Localized Object)
```json
{
  "name": {
    "en-US": "Summer Sale - 20% Off",
    "es-ES": "Venta de Verano - 20% de Descuento",
    "fr-FR": "Soldes d'Été - 20% de Réduction"
  },
  "description": {
    "en-US": "Get 20% off on all summer collection items",
    "es-ES": "Obtén un 20% de descuento en todos los artículos de la colección de verano",
    "fr-FR": "Bénéficiez de 20% de réduction sur tous les articles de la collection été"
  }
}
```

This pattern applies to all localizable fields including:
- `name` - Promotion display name
- `description` - Promotion description
- Extension fields that contain display text

## Typical pitfalls

### Design Anti-patterns
- **Hardcoding promotion logic in code** - Use rule engine patterns instead of if/else chains
- **Missing timezone handling** - Promotions must work correctly across time zones
- **Weak code generation** - Predictable patterns enable fraud
- **No version control** - Changes to active promotions must be tracked
- **Inflexible rule structure** - Rules should be composable and extensible

### Performance Issues
- **Not indexing code lookups** - Coupon validation must be fast
- **Loading all rules for evaluation** - Use efficient rule filtering
- **Missing caching strategies** - Cache promotion eligibility calculations
- **No batch code generation** - Generate unique codes asynchronously

### Integration Challenges
- **Tight coupling to commerce engine** - Promotions should be service-independent
- **No event streaming** - Missing real-time updates to other systems
- **Inconsistent tax handling** - Clear rules for pre/post-tax discounts
- **Poor inventory coordination** - BOGO promotions need inventory checks

### Business Logic Errors
- **Allowing infinite stacking** - Always set maximum discount limits
- **Missing fraud prevention** - Monitor unusual redemption patterns
- **No budget controls** - Track total discount exposure
- **Unclear precedence rules** - Define clear priority and exclusion logic
- **Missing audit trails** - Track all changes for compliance

### Common Implementation Mistakes
- **Not validating rule combinations** - Some conditions conflict
- **Missing currency handling** - Multi-currency must be explicit
- **No dry-run capability** - Test promotions before activation
- **Weak error messages** - Clear feedback when promotions don't apply
- **Missing retroactive handling** - Strategy for already-placed orders
