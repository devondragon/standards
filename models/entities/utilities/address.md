## Entity purpose

A standardized utility object for representing physical and mailing addresses across all entities in the MACH Alliance Common Data Model. It serves as the foundational structure for location information throughout commerce platforms, order management systems, logistics providers, and customer relationship management. The address model supports international address formats, validation requirements, and delivery specifications while maintaining consistency across diverse geographic regions and business contexts.

The Address utility object provides:
- Flexible international address formatting for 195+ countries
- Support for both structured and unstructured address data
- Delivery instructions and special handling requirements
- Geographic coordinates for mapping and routing
- Address validation and normalization metadata
- Type classification (residential, commercial, PO Box)
- Accessibility and delivery constraint information
- Multi-language support for international commerce
- Integration with address validation services
- Support for complex address scenarios (military, rural routes)

## Localization Pattern

The Address utility object supports flexible localization for international commerce. Fields that may need translation or local script support can accept either a simple string or a localized object.

### Single Language (Simple String)
```json
{
  "line1": "123 Main Street",
  "city": "New York",
  "delivery_instructions": "Leave at front door"
}
```

### Multi-Language (Localized Object)
```json
{
  "line1": {
    "en-US": "123 Main Street",
    "es-ES": "Calle Principal 123",
    "zh-CN": "主街123号"
  },
  "city": {
    "en-US": "New York",
    "es-ES": "Nueva York",
    "zh-CN": "纽约"
  },
  "delivery_instructions": {
    "en-US": "Leave at front door",
    "es-ES": "Dejar en la puerta principal",
    "zh-CN": "请放在前门"
  }
}
```

### Localizable Fields
- `line1`, `line2`, `line3`, `line4` - Address lines
- `city` - City name
- `district` - District or neighborhood
- `formatted` - Complete formatted address
- `delivery_instructions` - Delivery notes

### Format Considerations by Region

**North America (US, CA)**
- Street number before street name
- State/Province abbreviations common
- ZIP+4 format supported (US)

**Europe**
- Street name may come before number
- Postal code placement varies
- Building/staircase/floor details common

**Asia-Pacific**
- Local script essential for delivery
- Order often reversed (country → city → street)
- Building names more common than numbers

**Latin America**
- Neighborhood (barrio/colonia) important
- Reference points common
- Informal addressing frequent

## Core Components & Relationships

### Components

| Concept               | Description                          | Typical Source of Truth    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Address Lines         | Structured street address components | Address Validation Service |
| Geographic Region     | Country, state, city hierarchy       | Geographic Database        |
| Postal Code           | Mail routing code                    | Postal Authority           |
| Coordinates           | Latitude/longitude for mapping       | Geocoding Service          |
| Validation            | Address verification metadata        | Validation Provider        |
| Delivery Instructions | Special handling notes               | Customer Input             |
| Access Information    | Entry codes and restrictions         | Property Management        |
| Contact Details       | Phone/email for delivery             | Customer Profile           |

`Address` is utilized across many entities and systems:

- Customer profiles (billing/shipping addresses)
- Orders (delivery destinations)
- Store locations (physical addresses)
- Warehouses (fulfillment centers)
- Suppliers (business addresses)
- Returns (pickup locations)
- Tax calculations (jurisdiction determination)

### Typical Relationships

    Address 1 to 1 Store:::entity : "located at"

## Typical pitfalls

### Data Structure Issues
- **Fixed field assumptions** - Forcing all addresses into US-centric format breaks international commerce
- **Missing required fields by country** - Some countries require district/prefecture, others don't use postal codes
- **Single-language only** - Prevents proper delivery in countries requiring local script
- **No validation metadata** - Can't track whether addresses are deliverable or need correction

### Validation and Standardization Problems
- **Not validating on entry** - Invalid addresses cause delivery failures and customer dissatisfaction
- **Over-standardization** - Destroying valid local addressing formats to fit rigid rules
- **Ignoring validation suggestions** - Missing opportunities to correct common errors
- **No revalidation process** - Addresses become stale as postal systems change

### International Support Failures
- **Country-specific formats hardcoded** - Each country has unique address formatting rules
- **Character encoding issues** - UTF-8 support essential for global addresses
- **Missing coordinate support** - Many emerging markets rely on GPS over street addresses
- **No RTL language support** - Arabic and Hebrew addresses need special handling

### Delivery and Logistics Issues
- **No delivery instructions field** - Critical for successful last-mile delivery
- **Missing business hours** - Commercial addresses need delivery time windows
- **No access code storage** - Gated communities and secure buildings require codes
- **Ignoring address types** - PO boxes can't receive physical packages

### Privacy and Security Concerns
- **Storing unnecessary data** - Keep only required fields for each use case
- **No data retention policy** - Old addresses should be purged per privacy regulations
- **Weak access controls** - Address data is PII and needs protection
- **No audit trail** - Can't track who accessed or modified addresses

### Integration Challenges
- **Incompatible with carriers** - Each shipping provider has specific format requirements
- **Tax calculation mismatches** - Incorrect addresses lead to wrong tax rates
- **Poor geocoding** - Inaccurate coordinates affect delivery routing
- **No address deduplication** - Same address stored multiple times differently

### User Experience Problems
- **Complex form validation** - Frustrating users with overly strict rules
- **No address autocomplete** - Making users type full addresses increases errors
- **Missing common aliases** - Not recognizing "St" vs "Street" as equivalent
- **Poor mobile experience** - Address entry especially difficult on mobile devices
