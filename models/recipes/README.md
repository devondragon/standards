## Recipes

### Purpose

This directory contains **Recipes** - detailed implementation patterns and guidance for solving common business problems in MACH composable architectures. Each recipe provides a step-by-step approach to orchestrating multiple services and systems to achieve specific business outcomes.

Recipes are:
- **Vendor-neutral** - Focus on patterns, not specific products
- **Business-oriented** - Start with business goals and KPIs
- **Practical** - Include real-world considerations and pitfalls
- **Flexible** - Offer variants and alternatives for different contexts

### What is a Recipe?

A recipe documents:
- **Business objectives** and how composable architecture supports them
- **System orchestration** patterns between frontends, backend services, and third-party systems
- **Data flow** requirements and transformations
- **Implementation guidance** including common pitfalls and edge cases
- **Success metrics** to measure effectiveness

### Available Recipes

| [PDP Orchestration (on the fly)](PDP-orchestration-on-the-fly.md)             | Real-time product detail page composition | E-commerce sites needing fast, dynamic product pages   |
| [PDP Orchestration (optimized access)](PDP-orchestration-optimized-access.md) | Pre-optimized product data access layer   | High-traffic sites requiring sub-second response times |

### Recipe Structure

All recipes follow a consistent template ([view template](../templates/master-recipe-template.md)) that includes:

1. **Recipe Purpose** - Business goals and KPI alignment
2. **Recipe Overview** - High-level approach and rationale
3. **Typical Pitfalls** - Common mistakes to avoid
4. **Actors/Stakeholders** - Who's involved in implementation
5. **Trigger Points** - What initiates the process
6. **Recipe Flows** - Detailed sequence diagrams
7. **Systems Involved** - Services and their responsibilities
8. **Data Requirements** - What data flows where
9. **Variants/Alternatives** - Different approaches for different needs
10. **Failure Modes** - How to handle errors gracefully
11. **Success Metrics** - How to measure effectiveness
12. **Security & Compliance** - Important considerations

### How to Use Recipes

1. **For Architects**: Use recipes as reference architectures when designing composable solutions
2. **For Developers**: Follow the implementation flows and data requirements
3. **For Product Managers**: Understand the business value and success metrics
4. **For Operations**: Review failure modes and monitoring requirements

### Contributing New Recipes

When creating a new recipe:

1. Start with the [master recipe template](../templates/master-recipe-template.md)
2. Focus on a specific business problem
3. Document multiple approaches where applicable
4. Include concrete examples and data samples
5. Consider edge cases and failure scenarios
6. Define clear success metrics

### Key Principles

- **Generic over specific** - Patterns that work across vendors
- **Business-first** - Start with the problem, not the technology
- **Practical guidance** - Real-world considerations, not just theory
- **Cross-functional** - Useful for all stakeholders, not just developers
