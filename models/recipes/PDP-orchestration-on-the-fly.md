## Recipe Purpose

> [!NOTE]
> This recipe is a "simple" version of a more complex [PDP Orchestration with Access Layer Optimization Strategy](PDP-orchestration-optimized-access.md) recipe that has a complex and aggressive data view optimization approach.

To deliver a fast, reliable, and fully populated Product Detail Page (PDP) by orchestrating multiple back-end services into a single, customer-facing API. This enables consistent display of product information, pricing, inventory, and rich content across channels.

**Key Business Goals:**
- Improve PDP load time and performance
- Reduce page abandonment rate
- Enable non-dev marketing updates to product content
- Enable personalized or contextual PDP content
- Streamline cross-channel consistency (web, mobile, kiosk)

**KPI tie-ins:** Conversion rate, average order value (AOV), content engagement metrics, page load time, SEO rankings, content publish velocity.

---

## Recipe Overview

When a user requests a product page, the system must gather and assemble product data from multiple domains: product info, pricing, availability, media, and content slots. This orchestration handles the back-end coordination, ensuring fast, complete, and accurate PDP rendering.

#### Approach Rationale

In composable commerce, using an orchestration layer instead of front-end binding is advantageous for several architectural, operational, and business reasons:
##### Performance & User Experience
- Reduced Client-Side Complexity: Front-end binding means the browser must orchestrate multiple API calls, handle failures, and manage complex business logic. This creates slower page loads, increased JavaScript bundle sizes, and potential for user-facing errors during API failures.
- Access Layer Optimization: An integration layer can implement sophisticated data view strategies, data transformation, and response optimization that would be impossible or inefficient to replicate in every front-end instance.
- Network Efficiency: Instead of making multiple round-trips from client to various services, the integration layer can aggregate data server-side and return optimized payloads.
##### Security & Compliance
- API Key Management: Front-end binding exposes API credentials in client-side code or requires complex token management. The integration layer keeps sensitive credentials server-side.
- Data Sanitization: Customer data, pricing information, and business logic can be properly filtered and sanitized before reaching the client, preventing data leakage.
- Rate Limiting & Throttling: Protection against API abuse and managing third-party service rate limits is handled centrally rather than hoping each client implementation respects limits.
##### Business Logic & Consistency
- Centralized Business Rules: Complex pricing calculations, inventory allocation rules, and customer-specific logic should be consistent across all touchpoints. Front-end binding leads to duplicated logic and potential inconsistencies.
- Data Transformation: Converting between different service formats, handling regional variations, and applying business-specific transformations is better managed in one place.
- Workflow Orchestration: Multi-step processes like order placement (inventory check → pricing calculation → payment processing → fulfillment) require reliable orchestration that can handle partial failures.
##### Maintainability & Scalability
- Single Source of Truth: When a third-party service changes its API, you update the integration layer once rather than hunting through multiple front-end implementations.
- Service Evolution: New services can be integrated without requiring front-end changes. Legacy services can be deprecated gracefully.
- Testing & Debugging: It's much easier to test, monitor, and debug server-side integration logic than distributed client-side implementations.
##### Operational Excellence
- Monitoring & Observability: Centralized logging, metrics, and alerting for all third-party service interactions. You can track performance, errors, and usage patterns effectively.
- Fallback Strategies: Implementing circuit breakers, graceful degradation, and fallback mechanisms is more reliable server-side.
Deployment Independence: Front-end applications can be deployed independently of backend service changes, and vice versa.

---
## Typical pitfalls
- This approach outlines using orchestration to assemble multiple sources on the fly. This approach is ideal if your underlying services are fast and reliable or if you have to make multiple decision points and business logic that may limit the benefit of access layer optimization:
  - For example, if the output is regularly changing based on changing underlying data or unique user requirements (such as personalizing by segment or geography).
- Depending on the speed of underlying services, you may wish to add access layer optimization approaches to improve performance.

> [!TIP]
> The recipe [PDP Orchestration with Access Layer Optimization Strategy](PDP-orchestration-optimized-access.md) describes a more complex and aggressive data view optimization approach if the use case requires it.

- Marketing content from CMS (descriptions, features, benefits)

**Output:**
Fully composed PDP object containing all necessary data for client-side rendering.

### Data Lineage & Performance Considerations

- **Real-time vs. Cached:** Content can be served real-time or through optimized caching layers
- **Orchestration Strategy:** Parallel API calls reduce latency vs. sequential requests
- **Fallback Handling:** Graceful degradation when optional services are unavailable

### Privacy/PII Considerations

**Minimal Case:**
- Anonymous session data for general product viewing
- Location-based pricing without user identification
- Generic inventory availability

**Advanced Cases:**
- **Customer-specific pricing** requires authenticated session and secure data handling
- **Personalized content** must comply with consent management frameworks
- **Viewing history** integration follows data retention policies
- **Cross-border transfers** require appropriate data residency compliance
- **B2B scenarios** may expose negotiated rates requiring access control

| **Scenario**                      | **Impact**                                                     | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Commerce API Unavailable**      | Content pages show incomplete product information              | Implement circuit breakers; serve optimized product data; display degraded experience with "pricing unavailable" messaging                                                                                                     |
| **Missing or Invalid Product ID** | Broken product references in published content                 | Pre-publication validation hooks; automated broken link detection; fallback to similar product recommendations                                                                                                                 |
| **Partial Data Delivery**         | Inconsistent product information across page elements          | Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) layer ensures complete data sets; graceful degradation with placeholder content                                                                                                                     |
| **Rate Limits/API Quotas**        | Commerce data unavailable during high traffic                  | Implement API usage throttling; access layer optimization strategies; dedicated read replicas for content integration                                                                                                          |
| **Multi-Region Mismatch**         | Wrong currency/availability shown for user location            | Geographic routing validation; market-specific content variants; runtime region detection and correction                                                                                                                       |
| **A/B Testing Conflicts**         | Inconsistent pricing between CMS content and commerce checkout | Unified personalization layer; consistent experiment assignment; real-time data validation at transaction points                                                                                                               |
| **Access Layer Refresh Lag**      | Stale pricing/inventory shown in content                       | Event-driven access layer refresh; short access key lifetimes for commerce data; real-time validation warnings - see [PDP Orchestration with Access Layer Optimization Strategy](PDP-orchestration-cached.md) for more details |
| **Content/Product Sync Timing**   | Content published before product availability                  | Scheduled publishing workflows; product readiness validation; preview mode restrictions                                                                                                                                        |

## Security & Compliance Notes

> [!WARNING]
> This list is not exhaustive, and you must do your own due dilligence to ensure you meet the required security and compliance standards for your unique scenario, however, some common aspects to review are:

**GDPR/CCPA Implications:**
- Customer-specific product recommendations require explicit consent
- Product viewing history must support right-to-erasure requests
- Cross-border data transfers need appropriate safeguards (SCCs, adequacy decisions)
- Cookie consent required for personalization features

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Service-to-service authentication using OAuth 2.0 or API keys
- Customer authentication for B2B pricing and exclusive products
- Content author authentication with role-based access control
- API rate limiting per client to prevent abuse

**Data Protection:**
- TLS 1.3 encryption for all API communications
- PII data masking in logs and monitoring systems
- Secure credential storage using secrets management
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

**Content Compliance:**
- Product claims verification against regulatory requirements
- Age-gating for restricted products (alcohol, tobacco)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) for all content
- Multi-language content accuracy verification
