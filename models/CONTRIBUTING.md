# MACH Open Data Model initiative

## How to contribute
- Join a discussion on the MACH Alliance [Power of MACH Community Special Programs](https://community.machalliance.org/home/forum/boards/special-programs-ous) forum (tagged as [Open Data Model](https://community.machalliance.org/home/forum/boards/special-programs-ous?topicId=684876b4b4047405d2cd909e&topicName=Open%20Data%20Model))
- Contribute entities or recipes

## MACH Alliance Interoperability Task Force role
The MACH Alliance interoperability group has established this repository for the express purpose of documenting common models (as entities) and recipes using those models.

- Examples of new non-vendor specific entities and example implementations as recipes may be contributed by anyone (ISVs, SIs, individuals, corporations)
- MACH Alliance ISVs may contribute vendor-specific details of integrations as recipes

The Interoperability TF is responsible for:
- Define working cadence, best practices, contribution policies, licences, etc.
- Appointing TF members from among MACH Alliance membership
- Setting contribution guidelines, including vetting the validity and uniqueness of the contribution. **We may choose to reject patterns that are not recommended or are duplicative of existing contributions.**

## Feedback

We welcome:

* **Feedback** on existing documents and suggestions for improvements.
* **Proposals** for new documents describing interoperability standards and best practices for implementing MACH architecture.

To start a discussion:
1. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/machalliance/standards/issues/new) on this repository.
2. Link the document you want to discuss.
3. Explain why this change or addition is needed and what problem it solves.
4. Describe in detail what needs to be changed or added.

- Or simply make a pull request - (Write clean examples that comply with the existing recipe template)

## Contributor guide
- Understand the purpose of the project by reading the project description and key definitions of concepts such as entities, recipes, etc. We welcome:
  - MACH system integrators (SI) and client architects to contribute recipes based on their real-world examples
  - MACH ISVs to contribute recipes and entities based on their domains and integrations with other MACH vendors
- View the [Guide to creating canonical data models](templates/creating-canonical-data-models.md) in order to understand the folder structure and particularly the [Entity](templates/master-entity-template.md) and [Recipe](templates/master-recipe-template.md) templates for contribution.
- Examine the roadmap to see which additional domains or use cases need contributions
- Understand that contributions are documentation of existing concepts and are given to the MACH Alliance and released under the [CC BY 4.0 Licence](LICENSE).
