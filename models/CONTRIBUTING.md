# Contributing to the MACH Open Data Model (ODM)

> **This is a curated resource of production-proven patterns, not an open wiki**

The MACH Open Data Model is designed to capture real-world integration patterns that have been successfully implemented in production environments. We maintain high standards to ensure every contribution provides genuine value to the MACH community.

## üéØ Before You Contribute

### Prerequisites
1. **Production Experience Required**: All patterns must be based on actual real world implementations
2. **Template Compliance**: Contributions must follow our templates exactly
3. **Vendor Neutrality**: Patterns must work across multiple vendors
4. **Community Discussion**: Major patterns should be discussed in the [MACH Alliance ODM Forum](https://community.machalliance.org/home/forum/boards/special-programs-ous?topicId=684876b4b4047405d2cd909e&topicName=Open%20Data%20Model) first

## üìù Contribution Process

### Step 1: Validate Your Contribution
Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] A pattern successfully running in production
- [ ] Clear business problem it solves
- [ ] Evidence it works across multiple vendors (or could)
- [ ] Time to follow our templates exactly

### Step 2: Choose the Right Template
- **Entities**: Use [master-entity-template.md](templates/master-entity-template.md)
- **Recipes**: Use [master-recipe-template.md](templates/master-recipe-template.md)
- **Read**: [Creating Canonical Data Models Guide](templates/creating-canonical-data-models.md)

### Step 3: Prepare Your Submission

#### For Entities:
```markdown
## Required Information
- Entity name and purpose
- All fields with descriptions and types
- JSON example with realistic data
- Extension patterns for flexibility
- Which existing entities it relates to
```

#### For Recipes:
```markdown
## Required Information
- Business problem being solved
- Systems/platforms involved
- Complete data flow
- Working code examples
- Known limitations
- Success metrics from production
```

### Step 4: Submit Your PR

Your PR description MUST include:
```markdown
## Production Use Case
Company/Project: [Where this was implemented]
Timeline: [When it was implemented]
Scale: [Approximate usage metrics]

## Problem Solved
[Specific business problem this addresses]

## Vendors/Platforms Tested
[List of MACH vendors this works with]

## Community Validation
[Tag 2+ community members who can validate this pattern]
```

### Step 5: Community Validation
- Your PR needs 2+ validations from community members
- Validators should confirm they've seen similar patterns work
- Maintainers review validated PRs monthly

## üîç Review Criteria

Maintainers evaluate contributions based on:

1. **Production Proven**: Is this from a real implementation?
2. **Vendor Neutral**: Can this work across multiple vendors?
3. **Well Documented**: Does it follow templates completely?
4. **Unique Value**: Does this add something new?
5. **Best Practice**: Is this a recommended approach?

## ‚ö° Fast Track Options

Want your contribution reviewed faster?

1. **Perfect Template Compliance**: No formatting issues = faster review
2. **Community Pre-Review**: Get 5+ validations = priority review
3. **Reference Implementation**: Include working code = immediate attention
4. **Multiple Vendor Proof**: Show it works across 3+ vendors = fast track
