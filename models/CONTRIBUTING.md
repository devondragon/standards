- Contribute entities or recipes

## MACH Alliance Interoperability Task Force role
The MACH Alliance interoperability group has established this repository for the express purpose of documenting common models (as entities) and recipes using those models.

- Examples of new non-vendor specific entities and example implementations as recipes may be contributed by anyone (ISVs, SIs, individuals, corporations)
- MACH Alliance ISVs may contribute vendor-specific details of integrations as recipes

The Interoperability TF is responsible for:
- Define working cadence, best practices, contribution policies, licences, etc.
- Appointing TF members from among MACH Alliance membership
- Setting contribution guidelines, including
  - Vetting the validity and uniqueness of the contribution. We may choose to reject patterns that are not recommended or are duplicative of existing contributions.
 
## Contributor guide
- Understand the purpose of the project by reading the project description and key definitions of concepts such as entities, recipes, etc.
- View the [README.md](README.md) in order to understand the folder structure and particularly the [templates](/templates/) for contribution.
- Examine the roadmap to see which additional domains or use cases need contributions
- Understand that contributions are documentation of existing concepts and are given to the MACH Alliance and released under the [CC BY 4.0 Licence](LICENCE).

## How to Contribute

The standards in this repository are developed by the MACH Alliance Tech Council. We don't accept external contributions to change them. Each change must be formally approved by the Interoperability Standards Task Force.

However, we welcome feedback. If you think something could be improved, we'd love to hear your thoughts and have an open discussion about it.

We welcome:

* **Feedback** on existing documents and suggestions for improvements.
* **Proposals** for new documents describing interoperability standards and best practices for implementing MACH architecture.

To start a discussion:

1. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/machalliance/standards/issues/new) on this repository.
2. Link the document you want to discuss.
3. Explain why this change or addition is needed and what problem it solves.
4. Describe in detail what needs to be changed or added.

**Please don't submit Pull Requests** unless you're asked to by a repository maintainer (member of the Interoperability Task Force). Pull Requests that don't follow this rule will be closed.

The only exceptions to this rule are typo fixes and broken links.
