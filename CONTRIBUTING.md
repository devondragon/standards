# Contributing to MACH Alliance Standards

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MACH Alliance Interoperability Standards repository. This repository contains two distinct types of content with different contribution models:

## üìÇ Repository Structure & Contribution Models

### 1. Core Standards & Architecture (Restricted)
**Location**: `/reference/`, `/whitepapers/`, `/src/diagrams/`, root-level docs

These foundational documents are managed by the MACH Alliance Tech Council and require formal approval from the Interoperability Standards Task Force.

**Contribution Process**:
- Open an [issue](https://github.com/machalliance/standards/issues/new) for discussion
- Wait for Task Force review and invitation
- Submit PR only when explicitly requested
- **Exception**: Typo fixes and broken links can be submitted directly

### 2. Open Data Model (Community-Driven)
**Location**: `/models/` directory

The ODM welcomes community contributions of production-proven patterns and integrations.

**Contribution Process**:

- Submit PRs directly for entities and recipes
- Community validation and monthly review process
