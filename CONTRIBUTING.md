## How to Contribute

The standards in this repository are developed by the MACH Alliance Tech Council. We don't accept external contributions to change them. Each change must be formally approved by the Interoperability Standards Task Force.

However, we welcome feedback. If you think something could be improved, we'd love to hear your thoughts and have an open discussion about it.

We welcome:

* **Feedback** on existing documents and suggestions for improvements.
* **Proposals** for new documents describing interoperability standards and best practices for implementing MACH architecture.

To start a discussion:

1. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/machalliance/standards/issues/new) on this repository.
2. Link the document you want to discuss.
3. Explain why this change or addition is needed and what problem it solves.
4. Describe in detail what needs to be changed or added.

**Please don't submit Pull Requests** unless you're asked to by a repository maintainer (member of the Interoperability Task Force). Pull Requests that don't follow this rule will be closed.

The only exceptions to this rule are typo fixes and broken links.
