# MACH Alliance Interoperability Standards

The resources collected in this repository aim to **enable software developers to lead their company’s transformation to a composable web architecture following MACH principles.** This includes:

* Interoperability standards and reference materials which facilitate easy integration and collaboration across various platforms
* Typical platform categories and the roles of each platform in a composable digital solution landscape
* Reference architecture diagrams and entity samples to illustrate and support interoperability, which aim to ensure a smooth and cohesive digital ecosystem

## What are the MACH principles?

The [MACH Alliance](https://machalliance.org/) promotes a technology ecosystem that is based on four key principles: Microservices-based, API-first, Cloud-native SaaS, and Headless. These principles ensure maximum flexibility, scalability, and interoperability for digital commerce platforms and other business applications.

* **Microservices-based:** Microservices architecture breaks down a traditional monolithic application into smaller, independent services that are easier to develop, deploy, and scale.

* **API-first:** An API-first approach means that applications are designed with the intention of being accessed and interacted with primarily through APIs. This promotes ease of integration and extensibility.

* **Cloud-native SaaS:** Cloud-native software is designed to take full advantage of cloud computing capabilities, such as scalability, reliability, and flexibility. SaaS (Software as a Service) refers to software that is delivered over the internet, rather than installed on-premises.

* **Headless:** Headless technology decouples the front-end and back-end of an application, allowing for greater flexibility in how the user interface is built and delivered.

By adhering to these principles, the MACH Alliance aims to foster an ecosystem of interoperable, best-of-breed technology solutions that empower businesses to build flexible, scalable, and future-proof digital platforms.

## Guidance for software architects and technology leaders

Not sure where to start on your composable implementation journey? We recommend referencing these guides in the order they appear here. Dive into [reference materials](/reference/) and [diagrams](/src/diagrams/) for additional detail.

### Understanding composable architectures

These guides introduce composable architectures at a high level, providing reference architectures and guidance on evaluating and integrating technologies.

### Leading the transformation

Coming later. These guides will describe how to transition to an composable architecture as an organization.

### Implementing composable

Coming later. These guides will describe at a detailed component level how to implement a composable architecture, as well as expectations for system interoperability.

## Reference materials

* **[Platform definitions](./reference/platforms.md):** defines three-letter-acronym platforms you’ll come across frequently in MACH materials.
* Platform roles guidance: [See High detail version of reference architecture for Platform Responsibility definitions](/src/diagrams/MACH%20Alliance%20Reference%20Architecture%20Diagrams-rev1.4.pdf)

* Materials we’ll add in the future:
  * Entity reference
  * Canonical Data Model (CDM)
  * Interoperability Protocols best practice
  * Interoperability Terminology
